# Discord.js v14 template

## Overview

This is a simple discord.js v14 bot template.

It comes with a **basic structure** that should help you get started with your project in **no time**.

## Mandatory dependecies

In order to make this template work you have to add the following dependecies:

- `npm i discord.js discord-api-types @discordjs/rest`
- `npm i -D chalk@4.1.2` &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Terminal string styling_
- `npm i -D dotenv` &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Environment variables_
- `npm i -D nodemon` &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_Automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected_

## Must-do

You need to **_create a file_** to store your **_environment variables_** that must remain private.

- Create a **_.env_** file in the **_root_** of the project
  - **_.env_** content:
    - ```
      TOKEN = [your bot's token]
      BOT_ID = [your bot's ID]
      ```
    - **_TOKEN_**: visit Discord Developer Portal https://discord.com/developers/applications
    - **_BOT_ID_**:
      - Open Discord and navigate to your server
      - User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode > ON
      - Right click on your bot > Copy ID

## How to run your app

Once everything has been set up you can:

- **_Simply execute the project:_**
  - `npm start`
- **_Test the project for development with nodemon:_**
  - `npm start`

I'm just an average italian guy who's still deciding between "Computer Science" and "Computer Science and Engineering".
Hence, you won't find neither a professional nor a native english speaker, just a passionate coder.
